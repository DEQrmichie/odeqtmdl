\description{
Inventory of Oregon TMDL information for each named stream in watershed assessment units.
The information is summarized for each AU_GNIS. AU_GNIS is a concatenation of
the Oregon watershed assessment unit ID (AU) and the NHD GNIS name.
Other assessment Unit types are not included in this table (e.g. Stream/River, Lakes/Reservoirs, Estuaries/Bays).
See \code{\link{tmdl_au}} for the TMDL summary for all assessment unit types, including watershed units.
See \code{\link{tmdl_reaches}} for TMDL information summarized for each NHD reach.
}
\details{
Note the TMDL information is still being assembled and is undergoing review.
Some information may not be accurate. See each relevant TMDL document for the
official record and more information. TMDLs developed by tribal governments are not included at this time. The inventory
is still being developed and some information may not be accurate.
A full listing of all non-tribal TMDL actions in Oregon can be viewed using \code{\link{tmdl_actions}}.

NHD values are derived from NHDH_OR_931v220, which is the current version used for DEQ business data. Database fields include:

\itemize{
  \item action_id:	EPA ATTAINS Action ID assigned to each TMDL document.
  \item TMDL_wq_limited_parameter:	Name of the water quality limited 303(d) parameter that the TMDL addresses.
  \item TMDL_pollutant:	Name of TMDL pollutant causing the water quality impairment.
  \item TMDL_scope: Provides information about how the TMDL applies.
     \itemize{
     \item TMDL:	The TMDL was developed to address a 303(d) listing or future listing in this assessment unit.
     \item Allocation only: A TMDL allocation applies in this assessment unit
                           but the TMDL does not address a 303(d) listing or future listing.
                           Typically this situation is applicable for tributaries or canals
                           that are upstream of the reach where the "TMDL" applies.
                           The pollutant reduction in the upstream reach is needed to achieve the
                           TMDL loading capacity of the downstream reach.
     \item Advisory allocation: A TMDL allocation may apply
                           based on assessment of source loads and if pollutant
                           reduction is needed to achieve a TMDL allocation or
                           loading capacity downstream. See TMDL document for details and requirements.
                           The TMDL does not address a 303(d) listing or future listing in this reach.
                               }
  \item Period: Identifies the fish use period that the TMDL addresses. Only used for TMDLs that address temperature or dissolved oxygen.
     \itemize{
     \item year_round: TMDL addresses only non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     \item spawning: TMDL addresses only spawning uses for the temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     \item Both: TMDL addresses both spawning and non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     \item Mixed: TMDL addresses different fish use periods in different sections of the assessment unit.
     }
  \item Source:
     \itemize{
     \item Point source: Identifies assessment units where pollutant loading is from point sources only.
     \item Nonpoint source: Identifies assessment units where pollutant loading is from nonpoint sources only.
     \item Both: Identifies assessment units where pollutant loading is from point sources and nonpoint sources.
     }
  \item Pollu_ID: DEQ water quality parameter ID. ID is for the parameter in 'TMDL_wq_limited_parameter'.
  \item HUC6: Basin six digit USGS hydrological unit code
  \item HUC6_Name: USGS Basin name.
  \item HUC6_full: Concatenation of the HUC_6 and HU_6_NAME fields.
  \item HUC8: Subbasin six digit USGS hydrological unit code.
  \item HUC8_Name: USGS Subbasin name.
  \item HUC8_full: Concatenation of the HUC8 and HUC8_Name fields.
  \item AU_ID:	Assessment Unit ID.
  \item AU_Name: Name of the assessment unit
  \item AU_GNIS_Name: Assessment unit and GNIS name concatenation.
  \item AU_GNIS: Same as GNIS name but with a few additional names not in NHD.
  \item TMDL_length_km: Length of the assessment unit in kilometers where TMDL_scope = 'TMDL'. Length is calculated using the linear flowline feature in Albers Equal Area projection.
  \item Allocation_only_km: Length of the GNIS assessment unit in kilometers where TMDL_scope = 'Allocation only'.
  \item Advisory_allocation_km: Length of the GNIS assessment unit in kilometers where TMDL_scope = 'Advisory allocation'.
  \item AU_length_km: Length of the entire assessment unit in kilometers. Length is calculated using the linear flowline feature in Albers Equal Area projection.
  \item AU_GNIS_length_km: Length of the GNIS assessment unit in kilometers. Length is calculated using the linear flowline feature in Albers Equal Area projection.
  \item TMDL_AU_GNIS_Percent: Percent of the GNIS assessment unit where a TMDL has been developed to address a 303(d) listing or future listing.
  \item Allocation_AU_GNIS_Percent: Percent of the GNIS assessment unit where a TMDL allocation applies.
