\description{
Inventory of where Oregon TMDLs have been developed based on the high resolution
National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) version NHDH_OR_931v220.
The \code{tmdl_reaches} data table is very large so it may take a minute to load.
}
\details{
Note the TMDL information is still being assembled and is undergoing review.
Some information may not be accurate. See each relevant TMDL document for the
official record and more information. TMDLs developed by tribal governments are not included at this time. The inventory
is still being developed and some information may not be accurate.
A full listing of all non-tribal TMDL actions in Oregon can be viewed using \code{\link{tmdl_actions}}.

Database fields include:

\itemize{
  \item action_id:	EPA ATTAINS Action ID assigned to each TMDL document.
  \item TMDL_wq_limited_parameters:	Name of the water quality limited 303(d) parameter that the TMDL addresses.
  \item TMDL_pollutant:	Name of TMDL pollutant causing the water quality impairment.
  \item TMDL_scope: Provides information about how the TMDL applies.
     \itemize{
     \item TMDL:	The TMDL was developed to address a 303(d) listing or future listing in this reach.
     \item Allocation only: A TMDL allocation applies in this reach
                           but the TMDL does not address a 303(d) listing or future listing.
                           Typically this situation is applicable for tributaries or canals
                           that are upstream of the reach where the "TMDL" applies.
                           The pollutant reduction in the upstream reach is needed to achieve the
                           TMDL loading capacity of the downstream reach.
     \item Advisory allocation: A TMDL allocation may apply
                           based on assessment of source loads and if pollutant
                           reduction is needed to achieve a TMDL allocation or
                           loading capacity downstream. See TMDL document for details and requirements.
                           The TMDL does not address a 303(d) listing or future listing in this reach.
                               }
  \item Period: Identifies the fish use period that the TMDL addresses. Only used for TMDLs that address temperature or dissolved oxygen.
     \itemize{
     \item year_round: TMDL addresses only non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     \item spawning: TMDL addresses only spawning uses for the temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     \item Both: TMDL addresses both spawning and non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
     }
  \item Source:
     \itemize{
     \item Point source: Identifies reaches where pollutant loading is from point sources only.
     \item Nonpoint source: Identifies reaches where pollutant loading is from nonpoint sources only.
     \item Both: Identifies reaches where pollutant loading is from point sources and nonpoint sources.
     }
  \item Pollu_ID: DEQ water quality parameter ID. ID is for the parameter in 'TMDL_wq_limited_parameter'.
  \item geo_id:	Unique ID assigned to the NHD reaches codes where a TMDL target applies. ID is structured as YearTMDLissued_ShortTMDLdocName_TargetGeoArea.
  \item HUC6: Basin six digit USGS hydrological unit code.
  \item HUC6_Name: USGS Basin name.
  \item HUC6_full: Concatenation of the HUC6 and HUC6_Name fields.
  \item HUC8: Subbasin eight digit USGS hydrological unit code.
  \item HUC8_Name: USGS Subbasin name.
  \item HUC8_full: Concatenation of the HUC8 and HUC8_Name fields.
  \item HUC10: Watershed ten digit USGS hydrological unit code.
  \item HUC10_Name: USGS Watershed name.
  \item HUC10_full: Concatenation of the HUC10 and HUC10_Name fields.
  \item GLOBALID: Unique ID for every NHD reach record. Used for joins with TMDL GIS features.
  \item Permanent_Identifier: NHD Permanent Identifier.
  \item ReachCode: NHD reach code.
  \item GNIS_Name: Proper name, specific term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is known
  \item GNIS_ID: Unique identifier assigned by GNIS, length 10.
  \item AU_ID:	Assessment Unit ID.
  \item AU_Name: Name of the assessment unit.
  \item AU_Description: Assessment unit descriptions.
  \item AU_GNIS_Name: Assessment unit and GNIS name concatenation.
  \item AU_GNIS: Same as GNIS name but with a few additional names not in NHD.
  \item LengthKM: Length of linear feature based on Albers Equal Area.
